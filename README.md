# HalfKOS

**HalfKOS** is a lightweight, preemptive operating system designed for resource-constrained microcontrollers, running on devices with as little as **512 bytes of RAM**. It provides a structured and efficient way to manage multitasking without the overhead of a full RTOS, making it ideal for ultra-low-power applications like IoT devices.

## Design Goals
- **Tiny footprint**: Runs on microcontrollers with as little as 512 bytes of RAM.
- **Preemptive multitasking**: Allows tasks to share CPU time efficiently.
- **Portability**: Designed to be easily portable to other microcontrollers.
- **Simplicity**: Minimal setup and intuitive APIs for easy integration.


## Features

T.B.D.

### Supported Hardware
The current release supports the **MSP430G2553** microcontroller. Support for additional platforms is planned for future releases.
